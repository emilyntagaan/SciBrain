# ScriBrain
SciBrain is an AI-powered website that generates reviewers and quizzes from user-provided materials such as PDFs, images, or text. Developed with Dion Gabriel Tabanao, this capstone project was created for a Grade 12 STEM group at Our Lady Of Lourdes College Foundation to improve study efficiency and support digital learning.
